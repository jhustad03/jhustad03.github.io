            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <h3>Then</h3>
            <p class="section-description">
                I’m from San Jose, California, and I’ve always been drawn to creativity, adventure, and the outdoors. Whether it’s making short films, hiking, or playing sports, I love being active and pushing myself to try new things. I even spent three months on a camping trip, which made me appreciate the simplicity and freedom of being out in nature. I also played lacrosse and ice hockey, which taught me a lot about discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—things I carry with me in everything I do.
            </p>

            <h4>Now</h4>
            <p class="section-description">
                Now, I’m studying advertising with a minor in entrepreneurship at the University of Oregon. I’m really interested in the way creativity and business intersect, and I want to use storytelling and marketing to bring ideas to life. Whether it’s through filmmaking, branding, or building something of my own, I’m always looking for new ways to challenge myself and create something meaningful.
